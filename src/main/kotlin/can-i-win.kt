/**
 * In the "100 game," two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1..10.
 * The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.
 *
 * What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?
 *
 * For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers of 1..15
 * without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.
 *
 * Given an integer maxChoosableInteger and another integer desiredTotal,
 * determine if the first player to move can force a win, assuming both players play optimally.
 *
 * You can always assume that maxChoosableInteger will not be larger than 20 and
 * desiredTotal will not be larger than 300.
 *
 * Example
 *
 * Input:
 * maxChoosableInteger = 10
 * desiredTotal = 11
 *
 * Output:
 * false
 *
 * Explanation:
 * No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
 * The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
 * If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
 * The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
 * Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.
