##### Update 3/14/2018: 
It's exciting to see 3 stars -- at lease someone cares. From my personal experience, Kotlin might not be the best language to solve leetcode problems -- I prefer Python here.   
This is not to say Kotlin is not good, but its power is more on the developing side -- the ability to create literally every tool/extension we want. But for short algorithm code, Kotlin has the burden of dealing with null.    
Anyway Kotlin is better than Java for leetcode problems.    
Thanks for your support and now I want to keep updating this repo.
